## Assignment Description

For your final project in Advanced Programming Techniques, you will demonstrate your ability to apply advanced programming concepts in a practical project. The project consists of three parts:

- Software Deliverable: The functional software that meets the project requirements.
- Written Deliverable: A comprehensive written document that either presents a detailed technical paper or a user manual, depending on the nature of your project.
- Oral Deliverable: A video demonstration where you present your software, explain key aspects of its design and functionality, and discuss the challenges encountered during development.

### Part 1: Software Deliverable

Your software project should meet the technical specifications outlined in the project guidelines. It must be fully functional, well-documented, and demonstrate an understanding of advanced programming techniques such as object-oriented design, algorithm optimization, or multi-threading.

### Part 2: Written Deliverable

#### A. Technical Paper (For Computer Science Experiment Projects)

If your project is a computer science experiment (e.g., comparing the performance of different data structures or algorithms under various conditions), your written deliverable should be a technical paper. This paper should provide an in-depth analysis of the experiment, including:

- Abstract: A concise summary of your project, including the problem you are addressing, your methodology, and key results.

- Introduction: An introduction to the problem, the motivation for the experiment, and the goals of your research.

- Literature Review: An overview of existing work or related research in the area of study. This can include algorithms or data structures similar to those you are comparing.

- Methodology: A detailed description of how the experiment was set up, including data sets, algorithms, and performance metrics used.

- Results and Discussion: Present the results of your experiment, including graphs, and performance analyses. Discuss your findings and any anomalies or unexpected results.

- Conclusion: Summarize the findings of the experiment, and propose potential directions for future research.

- References: Cite all sources, papers, or documentation you referenced while preparing your project.

#### B. User Manual (For Software Deliverables)

If your project is primarily a software deliverable (e.g., a tool or application), your written deliverable should be a user manual. This manual should serve as a guide for users who want to install and use your software. It should include:

- Title Page: Include the name of your software, your name, and the course details.
- Introduction: Provide an overview of your software, including its purpose, key features, and target audience.
- Installation Instructions: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for installing your software, including prerequisites, dependencies, and troubleshooting tips.
- Features and Usage: Describe the main features of your software. Include detailed instructions on how to use the software, with examples and screenshots.
- Screenshots and Diagrams: Include relevant screenshots to help users understand the software interface and features.
- System Requirements: Specify the hardware and software requirements to run the software.
- Program Design and Architecture - talk about how the program is designed and built internally.
- References: Cite all sources, papers, or documentation you referenced while preparing your project.

### Part 3: Oral Deliverable

The oral deliverable is a video presentation where you will:

- Introduce Your Project: Start by introducing your software and its purpose. Explain what problem it addresses and why it is important or relevant.
- Walk Through the Software: Demonstrate your software in action, showing how it works and highlighting key features.
  - For software projects, this includes demonstrating the core functionality, explaining how the user interacts with the software, and showing any advanced features or configurations.
  - For experimental projects, walk through the key components of your experiment (e.g., code implementation, algorithm comparison, or data collection process).
- Explain Key Design Decisions: Discuss the critical decisions made during the design and development process. This could include:
    - Design patterns or architecture choices
    - Algorithm selection or performance considerations
    - Challenges faced during development and how you overcame them
    - Any trade-offs made during implementation (e.g., simplicity vs. performance)
-Demonstrate Key Issues: Identify any major issues or challenges you faced during the project. Discuss how you addressed these challenges and what you learned from them.
- Conclude the Presentation: Summarize the key points of your project, including any lessons learned or future improvements you plan to make. Discuss the potential impact of your project and any applications it could have.

The video should be 5-15 minutes in length and should showcase your communication skills, technical knowledge, and ability to clearly explain complex concepts. The video should be clear, well-organized, and professional.

You can use Zoom to do this. You don't have to record your face, only your voice and the screen. Go through the answer and explain how you arrived there. Your goal with this is to convince me you know what you are talking about, so I want you to do this without reading a script or written answer. Just go through and explain what your project does. When you are done, upload your recording to your Lehigh Drive and add a link below.

⚠️IMPORTANT: Make sure you give blanket permission to the link holder to view the file

## Submission

Please submit your completed exam, which should include:

- Source code for your project.
- Your written report.
- A link to your oral report.

Also, keep in mind:

- Only files under version control in your forked assignment repository will be graded. Local files left untracked on your computer will not be considered.
- Only code committed and pushed prior to the time of grading will be accepted. Locally committed but unpushed code will not be considered.
- Your assignment will be graded according to the [Programming Assignment Grading Rubric](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V0nBt3Rz6uFMZ9mIaFioLF-48DFX0VdkbgRUDM_eIFk).
- Your submission should be organized, well-commented, and easy to understand. Remember to document any assumptions you made during the implementation process, as well as any limitations of your solution. Your final exam will be graded on the correctness, completeness, and clarity of your submission.
