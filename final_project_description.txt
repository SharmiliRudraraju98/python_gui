Project Title: Visual Data Structure Learning Platform
Project Description:
This will be an educational application that provides interactive visualizations of common data structures and their operations. Users can see real-time animations of how data structures work, manipulate them through a graphical interface, and understand their internal workings. The application will initially focus on trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees) and graphs, with an interactive workspace where users can create, modify, and analyze these structures.
The platform will feature split-screen functionality: one side showing the actual data structure visualization, and the other showing the corresponding memory representation or relevant metrics (like tree height, balance factor, etc.). Users can perform operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal through button clicks or drag-and-drop interactions, watching how each operation affects the structure in real-time.

4-Week Breakdown:
Week 1:

Set up the basic GUI framework using a Python library like tkinter or PyQt
Implement the base classes for data structures (Node, Tree, Graph)
Create the basic window layout with menu bar and split-screen setup
Develop basic rendering capabilities for nodes and edges

Week 2:

Implement Binary Search Tree visualization and basic operations

Add node creation and positioning logic
Create animation system for node movements
Implement insertion operation with visual feedback
Add deletion operation with visual feedback

Week 3:

Add advanced tree features

Implement tree traversal animations (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
Add AVL tree balancing visualizations
Create interactive tree modification tools (drag-and-drop nodes)
Add metrics panel showing tree properties

Week 4:

Add any new features and extend functionality

Add save/load functionality for created structures
Implement step-by-step operation playback
Create help documentation and tutorials
Add export functionality for diagrams
Bug fixes and performance optimization
Add additional features if time permits (graph visualization, etc.)
